 * Exception, which should be thrown, if the initialization of 
 * some {@link Arrival} or {@link Service} fails, due to a 
 * prohibited choice of parameters. For example initializing an
 * arrival with exponentially distributed arrivals needs a rate
 * parameter lambda larger zero. Initializing 
 * {@link ExponentialSigma} with a non-positive parameter hence
 * throws a <code>BadInitializationException</code>.
 * The field <code>initvalue</code> can be used to give the invalid
 * initial value, causing the exception.
