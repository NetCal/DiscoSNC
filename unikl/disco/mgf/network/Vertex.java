/**
 * This class represents a node in the network. It knows about its
 * incoming arrivals, their priorities at this node and their 
 * flow_ids. This is done by the two HashSets <code>priorities
 * </code> and <code>incoming</code>. The first contains all flows
 * arriving at the node and their priorities. The latter contains
 * all flows, for which an arrival description is given. Further 
 * the vertex can determine, which flow is the next to serve.
 * The most important method in this class is <code>serve()</code>.
 * It is called to calculate the leftover service of this node, 
 * after serving the current flow (in expression the flow, which
 * has the highest priority and was not served yet). Further it 
 * returns the output bound of the served flow.
